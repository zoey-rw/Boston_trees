# Boston_trees
Shiny app for tree-planting in Boston

This app is designed to support successful tree-planting in Boston, with a goal of reducing the urban heat island effect. It is hosted at https://zoeywerbin.shinyapps.io/Boston_trees/, but can be generated locally from the files in this repo. Raw data is not stored here on Github, but is available upon request. Raw data is needed to run the files `prepMapData.r` and `prepTreeData.r`. Processed data files are included in the `data` folder and are sufficient for the app to run using the shiny::runApp() command.

The `www` folder includes images and icons for the app, as well as a custom CSS file. 

This work was supported by our BU URBAN Program, funded by a National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) grant to Boston University (DGE 1735087). R code for the app was written by Zoey Werbin.
